# Node.js 


### Node is a runtime environment for the use of JavaScript outside of its traditional in-browser environment. It is especially advantageous as compared to other server-side programming languages because of the way it implements I/O (Input, Output) cycles asynchronously. In the past with languages like PHP the only way of running simultaenous operations was to run multiple threads concurrently. In Node all actions are an event; so the JavaScript file can queue a callback function until the callback hears the event of its dependencies being returned. 

### What this means practically is lightweight and high-performance applications.
