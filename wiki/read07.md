# APIs and REST

## REST
- REST represents (hah) REpresentational State Transfer and can be better summarized as a stylistic guide for application architecture in which computers are able to directly communicate about their contents. Not only can they discuss their state, but they can also utilize a shared set of "verbs" to modify that state. 

## APIs
- API (Application Program Interface)
- A defined methodology for RESTful communications. APIs enable computers to transmit data via the web in the same way people do. At a particular URL there will be data and it will exist in a pre-defined structure. Understanding the structure enables other applications to make use of the same dataset.
