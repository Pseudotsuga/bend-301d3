# JQuery
JQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation to an incredible extent. As the name implies it utilizes CSS Selector Syntax to generate matched sets that can be thought of as the equivalence of Node Lists. The library’s API then includes a large number of methods that can be used to manipulate the elements that match the selector.

The first step to using JQuery is to include a script tag that references the version of JQuery that you desire. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) are a convenient method of incorporating JQuery into your projects. There a number of CDNs which host JQuery. An example of such a CDN can be found [here:](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/jquery)

I wrote an example fiddle [here:](https://jsfiddle.net/pseudotsuga/Loxq63rc/56/)
 > This fiddle changes the background color of a theoretically infinite number of section tags using jQuery. It accomplishes this in less than 25 lines of JavaScript.
