# SQL

## Structured Query Language
SQL is implemented in numerous formats and for this class we will be using PostgresSQL. SQL as a general standard describes a language and syntax used for the management of relational databases or tables. A table is composed of columns and rows where a row is a single instance or datapoint and the columns are the properties of that instance. 

!! SQL KEYWORDS ARE ALL CAPS FOR EASE OF RECOGNITION !!

!? ISN'T THIS DISCTINCTIVE ?!

### My paraphrasing of some SQL Keywords:
- SELECT - Filtering Keyword
- FROM - Targeting Keyword
- WHERE - Conditional Creating Keyword
- CREATE DATABASE - Create Database
- DROP DATABASE - Delete Database
- CREATE TABLE - Create Table
- DROP TABLE - Delete Table
- ALTER TABLE (ADD, DROP) - Used for the manipulation of columns. 
- LIKE - Comparison Keyword
- DISTINCT - Return only unique values
- INSERT INTO - Add a row
- BETWEEN - Establish acceptable ranges.
- LIMIT - Number of desired rows for return
- OFFSET - Filter which part of the limited set you receive.
- ORDER BY (ASC/DESC) - Sort the query return by column. 
### Common Operators
- = (Strict Equal)
- != (Does not equal)
- % (0 or more wildcard characters)
- _ (0 or 1 wildcard character)
