# Diversity and Inclusion

## Historical Context

This [article](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/) lays out a historical context wherein a [recession in the video game industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983) and the subsequent market response created a culture and marketing plan that gendered the American perception of video games. Then, because video games became the the primary introduction point for the general public into computers and programming, the demographics of people familiar with computers shifted disproportionately towards males. Specifically, in 1985 73% of Men reported using computer on at least a weekly basis as compared to 45% of Women. 

* As the proportion of computer familiarity shifted towards men, a positive feedback loop began on many levels. 
  - As a cultural norm, men were the ones who played video games and used computers making it less and less likely for women to feel comfortable approaching that space. 
  - Further, because men at large had and women at large lacked familiarity with computers the gendered partition began to ripple from the public into higher education and eventually the commercial space as well. 
  - To close the loop: Once educational and operational spaces became gendered to the extent they no longer closely resembled the demographics of the general public their products and services became equally gendered.


> It is interesting to note that in some ways this is a reversal of cultural norms from decades previous. When computers were primarily used for clerical or 'boring' work women held a higher ratio of jobs. [Additional information here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing#1940s)


## Data Visualization

Reviewing the [visualization](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/) of recent demographic information for the tech industry a few things stood out to me. It did confirm that across the board technology companies have more male employees than female employees. In almost all cases dramatically more male employees. It is not surprising after considering that our Congress and Fortune 500 CEOs are even more grossly inadequate in terms of representation. I'm not smart enough to declare gender parity in our legislative bodies and economy prerequisites of gender parity in any specific industry, but finding out certainly couldn't hurt anything. 

## Why Diversity Matters

Diversity of employees can only lead to diversity of ideas. When ideas are diverse problems are solved more efficiently. Efficient problem solving is at the core of every business venture.
